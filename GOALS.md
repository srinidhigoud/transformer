# Transformer Practice

## Goal

- Write a clean LLM code that has individual components and can scale to LLAMA level.
- Set up Docker / Bazel for the environment.
- Set up AWS instances or Cruise shells to run the code seamlessly (local vs remote).
- Set up benchmarking code:
  - PyTorch Profiler
  - NSYS
  - Jupyter Notebook
- Benchmark variants of Flash Attention and other optimization techniques.
- Optimize the code using:
  - `torch.compile`
  - TensorRT-LLM
  - Torch-TensorRT
- Try various decoding strategies:
  - Speculative Decoding
  - Multi-Token Decoding
- Apply Quantization:
  - SpinQuant
  - GPTQ
  - INT8 Quantization
- Perform parity analysis.

## AI-Assisted Debugging and Optimization

To streamline debugging, optimization, and parity analysis, we will leverage AI agents to suggest fixes, log failures, and improve over time. Here's the plan:

### 1. **AI Agents for Export Failures**
   - **Goal**: Automatically suggest fixes for export failures (e.g., to TensorRT or custom compilers) based on logs.
   - **Implementation**:
     - If the failure is already seen in logs, the AI agent suggests a known workaround.
     - If the failure is new, the AI agent uses tools like Perplexity to search the internet for suggestions.
     - Log the failure and wait for the user to find a workaround.
     - Log what worked and what did not work to improve the AI agent's suggestions over time.

### 2. **AI Agents for Parity Divergence**
   - **Goal**: Identify and resolve parity divergence between different implementations (e.g., PyTorch vs TensorRT).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use AI agents to analyze divergence in outputs and suggest potential fixes.
     - Log divergence patterns and resolutions to improve future suggestions.

### 3. **AI Agents for Optimization**
   - **Goal**: Suggest optimization techniques based on similar logs and benchmarks.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Analyze performance bottlenecks using profiling tools (e.g., PyTorch Profiler, NSYS).
     - Suggest optimizations such as kernel fusion, memory optimization, or quantization based on historical data.
     - Log successful optimizations and failures to improve future suggestions.

### 4. **Logging and Feedback Loop**
   - **Goal**: Create a feedback loop to improve AI agent suggestions over time.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Log all failures, workarounds, and successful fixes in a structured format.
     - Use this data to train or fine-tune the AI agents for better suggestions.
     - Allow users to provide feedback on the AI agent's suggestions to improve accuracy.

### 5. **Integration with Existing Tools**
   - **Goal**: Integrate AI agents with existing tools and workflows.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Integrate AI agents with Bazel, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines to provide real-time suggestions during builds and tests.
     - Use APIs or plugins to connect AI agents with tools like TensorRT, PyTorch, and Jupyter Notebooks.

### 6. **Scalability and Deployment**
   - **Goal**: Ensure the AI agents can scale with the project and are deployable in various environments.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Deploy AI agents as microservices that can run locally or on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Cruise shells).
     - Use containerization (Docker) to ensure consistent behavior across environments.
     - Monitor AI agent performance and scalability using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
